# Javascript DVD Animation

I've been studying how to use canvas with HTML and JavaScript.

While learning to create simple animations, I had the idea to recreate the iconic DVD loading screen visuals using JavaScript on the canvas.

I started by working with a moving rectangle on the screen, then added color-changing effects, and finally incorporated the logo on top.

## I used the following technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Next challenges:

- Make it spawn randomly
- Make the first color also be picked randomly
